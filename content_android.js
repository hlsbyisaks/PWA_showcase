Traditionally, web apps lacked support for certain key functionalities of app development. That is why we today see PWAs which support installation to home screen, offline use, push notifications and a full screen experience. Just like you would expect from a native app. These advantages makes PWA a viable choice for many businesses. Other advantages are: low space requirements, availability in areas with poor internet coverage and independent of platform specific app marketplaces with associated sales fees. <br>Stick around and try it out!",
